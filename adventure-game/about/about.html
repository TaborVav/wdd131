    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
        This project is still a work in progress. While it meets the basic project requirements, it doesn't fully fulfill my personal goals. The story isn't where I want it to be, and the puzzles are just placeholders and not what I envision.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, I plan to turn this into an immersive website with twists, turns, multi-tiered puzzles, and a deep, meaningful storyline. That is still to come, and I’ll be updating it regularly to bring those ideas to life. My goal is to create something far more engaging and complex than it currently is.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've already put countless hours into getting the code to behave how I want, and many more hours searching the internet for solutions to my coding dilemmas. It's definitely still a work in progress, but I hope you can see the vision behind it.
